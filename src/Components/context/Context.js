            description:"A job role as a data scientist is a dream for many. But in 2022, the traditional ways of getting into analytics is just not enough. Even after your concepts are crystal clear, an aspiring data scientist cannot expect to land their desired jobs just by applying when they see job openings. Times have changed, and one has to take other proactive steps to ensure that they crack the interviews that will land them in such rewarding roles. Here are a few ways to ease the process of landing data science job roles this year.Hackathons and competitions Hackathons and competitions are a great way to test ones own skills and understand what is needed out of you as a data scientist. Kaggle has emerged as a go-to platform for aspiring data scientists as well as those who are already in the profession to prove their skills and compete with like-minded people.  MachineHack is another immensely popular platform that frequently hosts challenges and hackathons to solve problems through data science and analytics.Active participation in different hackathons is a great way to learn new skills as well. Ayan Basak, who works as a data scientist at Snapdeal, says, “According to me, hackathons and competitions are very important components of one’s portfolio for a data scientist role. Especially for me, coming from an electronics engineering background having no formal education in DS, it has been a huge factor to advertise myself. It has also helped me to develop my technical knowledge and navigate across various challenges one might face in this domain.”",
